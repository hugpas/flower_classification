This project aims to automate the accurate classification of different flower species using image data.
Traditional manual classification by experts is time-consuming and requires specialized knowledge.
The motivation is to build a robust classification model and test different approaches to achieve high
accuracy in classifying flowers by image.

Motivation:
-   Manual classification of flowers is a labor-intensive process that doesn't scale well with large datasets.
    An automated system can process thousands of images quickly and consistently, saving time and resources.
-   Flower identification typically requires specialized knowledge, which may not be readily available. By
    training a model on expert-labeled data, we can make this expertise accessible to anyone with a smartphone
    or computer, democratizing access to botanical knowledge.
-   An accurate flower classification model can be a valuable tool for educational purposes, allowing students
    and enthusiasts to learn about different species interactively. Additionally, it can aid researchers in
    ecological and environmental studies by providing a reliable method for large-scale plant identification.
-   Accurate identification of flower species is crucial for monitoring biodiversity and conservation efforts.
    Automated classification can help in tracking the distribution of species, identifying endangered plants,
    and implementing conservation strategies effectively.
